## 📝 Code Standards

**Heavy Commenting Requirement**: All code in this project must be extensively commented to ensure maintainability and learning value for young developers:

- **Every function**: Document what it does, parameters, return values, and its role in the application
- **Every variable**: Explain what data it stores and why it's needed
- **Every file/module**: Header comment explaining the file's purpose and its relationship to other modules
- **Complex logic**: Step-by-step explanations of algorithms, state management, and user interactions
- **Component structure**: Explain the UI hierarchy, styling decisions, and responsive behavior
- **Business logic**: Document game rules, user flows, and data transformations

The goal is to make the codebase educational and accessible to developers learning React Native, game development, and child-friendly UI design.
