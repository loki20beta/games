### **Code Standards Established**
- **Heavy Commenting Requirement**: Every function, variable, and style documented
- **Educational Purpose**: Code serves as learning resource for React Native development
- **Child-Friendly Focus**: Comments explain age-appropriate UI design decisions

## üé® UI/UX Design Principles

### **Child-Oriented Interface Design**
- **Ages 3+**: All design decisions optimized for young children
- **Large Touch Targets**: Minimum 60-80px for accessibility
- **Visual Communication**: Minimal text, maximum visual cues
- **Step-by-Step Flow**: Simple progression through configuration

### **Color Scheme Strategy**
- **Neutral Base**: Light grays and whites for main interface
- **Accent Colors**: Blue for primary actions, green for selections
- **Future Theming**: Colors kept neutral for later customization
- **No Bright Colors Initially**: Reserved for future theming decisions

### **Responsive Design**
- **Screen Rotation Support**: Both portrait and landscape orientations
- **Dynamic Layouts**: Different spacing and arrangements for each orientation
- **Touch-Friendly**: All interactive elements optimized for small fingers

---

## üéÆ Game Configuration & Flow

### **Grid Size Options**
- **Small (2x2)**: 4 cards, 2 pairs - easiest for young children
- **Medium (4x4)**: 16 cards, 8 pairs - moderate difficulty
- **Big (6x6)**: 36 cards, 18 pairs - challenging for older children
- **Visual Representation**: Each button shows exact grid layout with small squares

### **Image Source Options**
1. **üòä Emojis**: Universal, no permissions needed (PRIMARY FOCUS)
2. **üì∑ Gallery**: Personal photos (complex implementation - deferred)
3. **üê∑ Peppa Pig**: Bundled themed assets (post-v1.0)
4. **üê∂ Bluey**: Bundled themed assets (post-v1.0)

### **User Flow Design**
- **Step 1**: Choose grid size ‚Üí Auto-advance (no Next button needed)
- **Step 2**: Choose image source ‚Üí Back + Next buttons appear
- **Navigation**: Icon-only buttons (‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back, ‚û°Ô∏è Next)
- **Visual Feedback**: Flashing Next button when selection made
- **Selection State**: Scaling + color change for selected items

---

## üì± Implementation Decisions

### **HomeScreen Specific Choices**
- **Two-Step Process**: Size selection, then image source selection
- **No Default Selections**: Everything starts unselected
- **Auto-Progression**: Grid size selection immediately advances to step 2
- **Button Design**: Grid buttons show exact visual layout preview
- **Text Removal**: Eliminated all descriptive text for purely visual interface
- **Animation**: Only flash Next button on image selection (not grid selection)

### **Navigation & Button Design**
- **Icon-Only Buttons**: Removed all text from Back/Next buttons
- **Emoji Cut-off Fix**: Special text rendering properties for proper emoji display
  - `includeFontPadding: false`
  - `textAlignVertical: 'center'`
- **Button Layout**: Circular Back button (60px) + flexible Next button
- **Consistent Heights**: All buttons maintain same height for visual balance

### **Screen Orientation Support**
- **Configuration**: Changed `app.json` from `"portrait"` to `"default"`
- **Responsive Layouts**: Different arrangements for landscape vs portrait
- **Dynamic Detection**: Real-time orientation change handling via Dimensions API

## üöÄ Development Phase Strategy

### **Phase Restructuring Decision**
**Original Plan**: Complex image selection system first
**REVISED Plan**: Emoji-first approach for faster MVP

### **New Phase Structure**
1. **‚úÖ Phase 1**: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
2. **‚úÖ Phase 2**: Home Screen Development (COMPLETED)
3. **üéØ Phase 3**: Emoji Selection & Basic Game Logic (MVP PRIORITY)
4. **Phase 4**: Core Game Polish (sounds, animations, optimization)
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced Image Selection (gallery photos)
6. **Phase 6**: Predefined Image Sets (Peppa/Bluey - post v1.0)
7. **Phase 7**: Final Testing & Release

### **Key Strategic Changes**
- **Emoji First**: Implement complete working game with emojis before adding complexity
- **MVP Approach**: Phase 3 delivers complete playable game
- **Iterative Development**: Each phase produces working, testable version
- **Complexity Deferral**: Gallery photos and bundled assets moved to later phases

---

## üìö Documentation & Code Quality

### **Documentation Standards**
- **Heavy Commenting**: Every function, variable, and style property documented
- **Educational Value**: Code serves as React Native learning resource
- **Relationship Mapping**: Components document their connections to other modules
- **Design Rationale**: Comments explain why certain approaches were chosen for children

### **Code Organization**
- **File Headers**: Every file explains its purpose and relationships
- **Function Documentation**: Parameters, return values, and role in application
- **Style Documentation**: Every CSS property explained with design reasoning
- **Architecture Notes**: Component hierarchy and data flow documented

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps (Phase 3)

### **Priority Tasks for Emoji Game MVP**
1. **Emoji Selection Interface**: Grid layout for browsing all emojis
2. **Game Board Creation**: Dynamic grid with selected emojis
3. **Card Component**: Flip animations and touch interactions
4. **Core Game Logic**: Shuffling, matching, win detection
5. **Basic Polish**: Simple win screen and restart functionality

### **Technical Requirements**
- **Emoji Data Set**: Comprehensive collection of all available emojis
- **Selection State Management**: Track chosen emojis and prevent duplicates
- **Game State Management**: Card positions, flip states, match tracking
- **Animation System**: Smooth card flips and basic feedback animations

## üîß Technical Debt & Future Considerations

### **Known Issues to Address**
- **Bundled Assets**: Peppa/Bluey images need optimization and asset management system
- **Performance**: Large grids (6x6) may need optimization for smooth animations
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and additional accessibility features
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support for future markets

### **Architecture Decisions Deferred**
- **Global State Management**: Currently using local state, may need Redux/Context later
- **Image Caching**: Simple approach for now, advanced caching for gallery photos
- **Offline Support**: Not required for emoji version, needed for bundled assets
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking for post-launch optimization
