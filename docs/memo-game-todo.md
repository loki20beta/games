## üêõ Bugs & Improvements

### üö® Known Issues
1. **Carousel with images behaves badly when there are less images than screen requires** - Selection carousel doesn't handle cases where selected images are fewer than what the carousel expects to display properly
2. **2x2 memo grid makes no sense** - The 2x2 grid only requires 2 pairs (4 cards total) which makes the game too simple and not engaging
3. **Grids on game screen should be improved** - Game board grid layout and card positioning needs refinement for better visual presentation
4. **Buttons on the game screen are overlapping game elements** - Action buttons (Restart, New Images, Home) are interfering with or overlapping the game board area
5. **Image picker limits with 20 images only** - Current gallery image selection is artificially limited to 20 images which may not provide enough variety for larger grids
6. **When selecting items carousel jerks and moves to initial state - it should stay in the same place** - Carousel position resets/jumps unexpectedly after image selection instead of maintaining current scroll position
7. **Backs of card should not contain any symbols or labels** - Card back design should be cleaner without brain emoji or "Memory" text for better visual appeal
8. **Navigation on game screen should be rethought** - Current three-button approach may not be the optimal navigation pattern for the game flow

### üí° Improvement Opportunities
- Review and optimize carousel behavior for edge cases
- Consider removing 2x2 grid option or find ways to make it more engaging
- Redesign game screen layout to prevent UI element conflicts
- Increase or remove gallery image selection limits
- Implement smoother carousel state preservation
- Simplify card back design
- Redesign game screen navigation for better UX
